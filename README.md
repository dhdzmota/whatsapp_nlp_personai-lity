==============================

This is a repo to make the analysis of a whatsapp conversation. In order for this repo to work, the conversation must be within two people.

This develops an AI called Personality, which learns from each individual phrase of the conversation. 
Then it can predict if a phrase is most likely to be said by one of the two users.

In order to execute this repo you need three requirements: 
- first of all, one must have python3.8
- Then you should create a new virtual environment.
- Finally, the information of the whatsapp conversation must be in the path: raw/data/ 
One can change the config files to have the desired configuration, in the path (config/config.yaml)

With all of this information it is just a matter of executing the following command: `python general_process.py`. This will automatically install the dependencies and train the model.
